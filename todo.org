- [ ] Game loop macro
- [ ] Helper macros for entity creation
  - [ ] Initialize state
  - [ ] Initialize components
  - [ ] Subscribe events
* DONE Update to latest version of austin and cljs <2015-02-21 Sat>
CLOSED: [2015-02-21 Sat 11:19]
- Austin 1.6 has issues so need to use version 1.7-SNAPSHOT or the repl doesn't work
- Had to update lein cljsbuild because it was to old to work with later cljs
- Now using the cljs required by core async latest
* TODO Use transients for local mutability <2015-02-01 Sun>
- [X] Figure out where we can use transients instead of normal hashmap operations
  - Systems?
  - Components?
  - CES operations?
- [X] Change all systems to use transients 
- [ ] Change collision detection to use transients of js arrays to do collision detection
* TODO "Threads" using core.async to run systems async based on deps
- Example: 
  - Given dependency tree [[a b] [a c] [c d]]
  - Run in this order where a vector denotes async operation [a, [b c], d]
- Probably need to cache this when game loop is initialized and recalc anytime a new system is added/removed

* TODO input->interaction is non-deterministic
FIX The output of the interaction hashmap is non-deterministic
because it is iterating through a hashmap where ordering is not
guaranteed. Need to iterate through only the accepted keycodes and
check if the input-state shows the key is "on". That way order is
controlled by the caller
* TODO Moveable component-fn calls get-component-state twice for every entity
According to the compiler, the move component requires multiple get-component-state calls
* TODO Move rate should be calculated by Moveable and should have component state
- Controllable should give the intended action based on user input i.e. :walk/run/attack :left/right etc
- Another component should interpret that into a new screen position
- Moveable needs to know if there is a collision before moving and intended position
- Collideable needs to know the intended position of the character

* TODO Function that generates all the animation declarations in each direction
* Live demo <2014-12-10 Wed>
Want to show how nice it is getting quick feedback loops and adding new features to the game
- Start a game from scratch and build it up
- Show how to inspect game state
- Show what it's like to work with
- Add a new system or feature
- Update an existing system on the fly
* TODO Key combinations from input
* DONE Add direction to movement and animation so you remain in that direction when standing <2015-01-18 Sun>
CLOSED: [2015-01-25 Sun 12:36]
- [X] Add stand as an action if not walking to Controllable
- [X] FIX animation stack keeps growing
  Need to remove the last action if a new one comes in
* TODO Debug layer for spatial grid
Show grid lines with numbers based on the spatial grid of that frame
* TODO Text rendering to sprites
* DONE Add attack animation <2015-01-25 Sun>
CLOSED: [2015-01-25 Sun 20:49]
* DONE Animation system <2015-01-17 Sat>
CLOSED: [2015-01-18 Sun 13:52]
- State machine for representing animations
- Hold on to the last state so that after an animation it goes back to what it was in
- State
  - Animation state key i.e. :walking :running
  - Frame number (for sprite sheet)
  - Dimensions of sprite sheet i.e width/height/frame-width/frame-height
- Abstraction for specifying an animation
- Key frame animation?
- Multi part sprites?
- [X] Renderable system should only call the stage render code
- [X] Move sprite updating based on movement to the animateable component
- [X] Can change to animateable system rather than renderable so all can share sprite stuff in one place. It only reacts to events so it's ok
  - Handles changes to sprites based on events including movement, animation, image swaps
- [X] Fix collision detection to use move component for position state or to get all info from the incoming event msg
- [X] Hold the hit zone info about an entity in the collidable component state
- [X] Position information should be held by the move component
* TODO Add skip frames to animation declaration to control animation speed
* DONE Fix replay not working when pressing :B <2015-01-03 Sat>
CLOSED: [2015-01-03 Sat 17:41]
- Looks like new events evaluation causes replay to not work
- One of the systems is clearing out messages before it can make it to the replay system
- Systems were seqing over a hashmap which is not guaranteed to have order
* TODO Use transients for things that are going to be iterated over and only need a local mutable value. 
Could work well for systems when iterating over them
* DONE Implement snapshots of game state and function to reload it <2014-12-07 Sun>
CLOSED: [2014-12-07 Sun 22:11]
- Take a copy of game state every n seconds and stick in vector
- Add an input control for a button to control stepping backward
- Thumbnail???? Would be super cool to render a mini image
* TODO Clean up tilemapping code
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Split up monster loops
* TODO Fix collision detection <2014-12-07 Sun>
It's not working due to broad collision detection not accounting for mass of entity and not factoring in intended movement

* DONE Finish up selectors for events <2014-12-13 Sat>
CLOSED: [2014-12-13 Sat 21:11]
If there are keys instead of a seq then recursively concat all the messages down the tree
* DONE Update subscription calls to filter out messages properly using the passed in boolean function for determining if an even should go into an inbox
CLOSED: [2014-11-23 Sun 11:37]
* DONE Behavior component (for demo) <2014-11-22 Sat>
CLOSED: [2014-11-23 Sun 11:37]
- Implement an AI behavior for entities with the :ai component
- Chose to go towards the player on each turn

* DONE Collision detection takes too much cpu time <2014-11-22 Sat>
CLOSED: [2014-11-23 Sun 21:46]
Profiling shows 70% of all cpu time each trip through the game loop
- Alternatives
  - Perform the lookup in one shot for all entities
  - Sort by x, y, use x y to figure out which entities you should check against
  - Spatial grid, divide up all the entities into a 2D grid once per frame, only compare entities in the same frame
  - Cache the collision checks as you don't need to compare every entity in reverse A->B AND B->A
* DONE Add spatial grid system <2014-11-23 Sun>
CLOSED: [2014-11-23 Sun 21:46]

* DONE Fan out messages takes too much cpu time <2014-11-22 Sat>
CLOSED: [2014-11-28 Fri 19:32]
Profiling shows 20% of cpu time each trip through the game loop
- There was a message leak that was piling up in the queue
- Make event subscriptions opt in not opt out
- Subscribe to an event from someone to a specific ID
- Make broadcast subscriptions optional?
- Subscribe an entity to a specific event
  Subscribe a component?
  Subscribe an entity?
  What does the entity get in their inbox? All messages?
  When do you remove messages from inbox?
  Need better parsing of event messages
- Resulted in 2x framerate from 8-10 to 18-20
  
  Put the messages in a hashmap instead of a list
  {:events {:subscriptions {}
            :queue {:<event-id> 
                     {:<source-id> [{:event-id :<event-id> :from :<from-entity> :msg <message>}]}}}}
  Subscribing to broadcast events is the concatenation of all values of keys nested in the event id
  A subscribed event is id -> from a specific entity

  Don't do a fan out as part of each system only check the events queue and make a lazy sequence that gets included as the inbox argument
  The event-system should clear out the event queue, handle new subscriptions/un-subscribes
* TODO Tiles that are non-traversable <2014-11-30 Sun>
Implement a tile map that checks for locations of entities that are collidable and sends an event if they are going to collide
- [ ] Create a spatial grid based on the map location (offset based on the view port of the screen)
- [ ] Put all tile collidable entities into their coordinates
- [ ] Iterate over all occupied tiles
- [ ] If they will be on a non-traversable tile, emit a tile collision event

* DONE Tiled tile map support <2014-12-07 Sun>
CLOSED: [2014-12-07 Sun 20:55]
Create a system for using tilemaps defined by Tiled
- [X] Load tile set image
- [X] Load json
- [X] Translate spec into tile set 
  https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/wiki/TMX-Map-Format#tileset
  - imageheight, imagewidth, tileheight, tilewidth, tileproperties
  - The spec for the tiles is in data.layers[0].data and is a one dimensional array with numbers representing the tile to use
  - To get the x, y of the tile
    - number * tile width
    - by the width of the image divided by 
- [ ] Update tile system to display it
  Needs to read the offsets of the tiles to shift the tileset image by x and y

* DONE Update documentation about event system <2015-01-03 Sat>
CLOSED: [2015-01-03 Sat 17:55]

* TODO Optimizations <2014-11-29 Sat>
- Systems iterate over all entities that have the component and then each component function
- Try to batch all the changes to the game-state in one shot
- Try using the reducers library for zero allocation collection operations
- Update component state and emit events takes up a significant amount of time
  number of hashmap ops = number of systems * number of entities with component * number of functions * number of events
- Lots of analysis on clojurescript performance http://wagjo.github.io/benchmark-cljs/
- [-] Use custom types using (.-a my-map) instead of keywords should be 3x faster <2014-11-30 Sun>
  - What about a macro that replaces get-in, assoc-in, update-in?
    Would need to always use our version of it which is dumb
  - Implement protocols for the custom type so that all the clojure map functions work with it
  - Underlying data structure will be a js array
  - [ ] Remove usage of assoc-in
    ./chocolatier/engine/ces.cljs:29:  (assoc-in state [:scenes uid] system-ids))
    ./chocolatier/engine/ces.cljs:68:  (assoc-in state [:entities uid] component-ids))
    ./chocolatier/engine/ces.cljs:86:  (assoc-in state [:state component-id entity-id] val))
    ./chocolatier/engine/ces.cljs:173:    (assoc-in state [:components uid] {:fns wrapped-fns})))
    ./chocolatier/engine/ces.cljs:211:    (assoc-in state [:systems uid] system-fn)))
    ./chocolatier/engine/systems/collision.cljs:101:      (assoc-in state [:state :spatial-grid] grid))))
    ./chocolatier/engine/systems/events.cljs:71:  (assoc-in state [:state :events :queue] {}))
    ./chocolatier/engine/systems/events.cljs:76:  (assoc-in state [:state :events] {:queue {} :subscriptions {}}))
    ./chocolatier/engine/systems/input.cljs:48:  (assoc-in state [:game :input] @KEYBOARD-INPUT))
    ./chocolatier/engine/systems/tiles.cljs:42:    (assoc-in state [:state :tiles]
    ./chocolatier/engine/systems/tiles.cljs:53:    (assoc-in state [:state :tiles] tiles)))
    ./chocolatier/entities/enemy.cljs:28:        (assoc-in [:state :renderable uid] init-render-state)
    ./chocolatier/entities/player.cljs:27:          (assoc-in [:state :renderable uid] init-render-state)
  - [ ] Remove usage of get-in
    ./chocolatier/engine/ces.cljs:81:  (or (get-in state [:state component-id entity-id]) {}))
    ./chocolatier/engine/systems/events.cljs:36:  (let [subscriptions (get-in state [:state :events :subscriptions entity-id])
    ./chocolatier/engine/systems/events.cljs:37:        events (get-in state [:state :events :queue])]
    ./chocolatier/engine/systems/events.cljs:38:    (mapcat #(get-in events (if (seqable? %) % [%])) subscriptions)))  
  - [ ] Remove usage of update-in
    ./chocolatier/engine/systems/events.cljs:31:  (update-in state [:state :events :subscriptions entity-id] conj selectors))
    ./chocolatier/engine/systems/events.cljs:61:    (update-in state (concat [:state :events :queue] selectors) conj event)))
  - This did not end up working because of the semantics of property access ".-" makes it impossible to construct at compile time without evaling symbols which means they can not be dynamically evalualted by putting thename of the key in a var for instance.
- [ ] Batch game state changes
  - After every system take all of the changes from component entities and events and make the update in one shot
  - Uses many assoc-in
  - Should components operate on all entities at the same time? That would allow a single assoc-in to the game state from the accumulated component state that could be reduced in

* TODO Use a context buffer instead of writing all to one canvas
- This should speed up the rendering of lots of sprites
- Example code
        function onLoad() {        
            // init stats
            var stats = new Stats();
            stats.getDomElement().style.position = 'absolute';
            stats.getDomElement().style.left = '0px';
            stats.getDomElement().style.top = '0px';
            document.body.appendChild( stats.getDomElement() );
            setInterval( function () { stats.update(); }, 1000 / 60 );
            
            // cache dom elements
            canvas = document.getElementById('my_canvas');
            context = canvas.getContext('2d');
            width = canvas.width;
            height = canvas.height;
            shipImage = document.getElementById('ship');
            
            // create canvas buffer
            canvasBuffer = document.createElement('canvas');
            contextBuffer = canvasBuffer.getContext('2d');
            canvasBuffer.width = 100;
            canvasBuffer.height = 100;
            contextBuffer.translate(50, 50); // so we can rotate about the center point
            
            // create lookup table for trig functions
            angleIncrement = Math.PI / 12;
            lookupTable = [];
            for (var i = 0; i < 5000; i++) {
                lookupTable[i] = {
                    x: Math.cos(i) * width - 150,
                    y: Math.sin(i) * height - 150
                };
            }
            
            // kick off the loop            
            window.setInterval(update, 16);
        }
        
        // this is called using a 16 ms interval
        function update() {
        
            // draw transformed ship image to a canvas buffer
            contextBuffer.clearRect(0, 0, 100, 100);
            contextBuffer.rotate(angleIncrement);
            contextBuffer.drawImage(shipImage, 0, 0, 50, 50);
            
            // draw 5,000 ships
            for (var i = 0; i < 5000; i++) {
                var lookup = lookupTable[i];
                context.drawImage(canvasBuffer, lookup.x, lookup.y);   
            }
        }
* TODO Use AABBTree (Axis aligned Bounding Box Tree) for collision detection
* TODO Make the input system emit an event
Currently it updates it's component state but that's it. SHould send an event to avoid other components querying it directly

* DONE Change game loop to wrap state in an atom so it can be inspected <2014-11-15 Sat>
CLOSED: [2014-11-15 Sat 17:34]
* DONE Fix controls does not register up and down <2014-11-16 Sun>
CLOSED: [2014-11-16 Sun 21:10]
* TODO Change mk-component to also handle subscribing to events
* TODO Change mk-system to also register it with a scene id
* DONE Pixijs wrapper <2014-11-16 Sun>
CLOSED: [2014-11-16 Sun 17:14]
Hide all of the javascript interop to keep the api clean. Consider a polymorphic layer so that a different renderer can be swapped in.
* DONE [#A] Port existing components and systems to new CES refactor <2014-09-21 Sun> :core:
CLOSED: [2014-11-22 Sat 14:48]
- core
  - [X] game-loop
- systems
  - [X] render
  - [X] input
    Collects system input and stores it every loop
  - [X] user control
    Does something with the user input
  - [X] tiling
  - [X] movement
    Should handle reconciling user input to changes not sure how this is different than user control
    - It's different because without it you will not be able to check if you should make the next move resulting in a loop where you get stuck because you are always colliding
    - Can the entity make it's next move?
    - Should take a message from input about changes and move if there is not also a message for a collision
  - [X] collision detection
    Check against all entities to see if they are colliding
  - [X] debug layer (draw circles around entities)
    - Turn red when a message collision message is present in the inbox
    - Not sure how to do this without coupling renderable, collidable, and debuggable
    - Make the selector for entities check multiple component-ids to get entity ids
    - Make custom component state parsing function
  - [X] Repl changing of game state via state atom
* TODO Query-like functionality for state                              :core:
Send a query with what you want and a filter function
Returns a sequence
* TODO Reset the game height on screen resize                          :core:
* DONE [#A] Cross system/component communication [7/7] <2014-10-12 Sun> :core:
CLOSED: [2014-11-15 Sat 17:03]
Need a way to share information between systems and components
- [X] Component/Entity events mailbox
  - Each component should get access to it by default (can be nil)
  - Example (send-msg state :from-component-id :from-entity-id msg)
  - Messages are async, no response is given, all info must be in the message
- [X] Need a system to clear out messages
- [X] Fan out messages to all subscriber inboxes
- Read only component state if it is not yours
- [X] Default component functions should also take in an inbox as an argument by default
- [X] Provide a way of emitting event from any component by passing it in as an arg
  - Currently, the component function returns a hashmap which will be merged in to the game state
  - We also need to provide a way of conveying that an event(s) should be emitted
  - Component functions can output 1 or 2 items 
    - If it's 1 item then it's the component state
    - If it's 2 items then it is component state and events
    - You can never just return events
- [X] Update game system fns now that component fns return updated game state rather than component state
  No longer need to use deep-merge which is recursive and costly. Instead use iter-fns on the collection of component fns in a system
- [X] Clear events inboxes after the system runs each component function
* TODO Protection against overflowing messages
  Throw an error if two many messages are generated. This will prevent avalanches and fail faster so it is easier to diagnose problems.
  - [ ] Limit on number of messages in an inbox
  - [ ] Limit on number of messages in the event queue

* DONE mk-component-fn should allow custom argument parsing function AND output wrapper <2014-10-12 Sun>
CLOSED: [2014-10-12 Sun 19:25]
- Currently, passing in a args-fn to mk-component-fn DOES NOT wrap the output of the function into a mergeable hashmap. The caller must handle it in the function. This is confusing since it is handled automatically if you don't pass in an args-fn.
- 9 times out of 10 you will want to automatically merge in component state
- This will get even harder to manage yourself if we have to handle merging of events
- Solution:
  - Allow optional argument parsing functions
    1. Calling the function with the desired arguments
    2. Wrapping the output of the function into something mergeable
* DONE [#A] Replace ces/deep-merge in systems with iter-fns since each component by default calls ces/update-component-state-and-events which returns an updated global state
CLOSED: [2014-11-16 Sun 17:24]
* DONE Make assertions in component functions to fail faster <2014-11-15 Sat>
CLOSED: [2014-11-15 Sat 13:13]
- [X] Throw an error if output is not a 2 item collection
- [X] Throw an error if component state or inbox or event-fn etc are nil

* TODO Change 'state' to 'game' everywhere it is passed in as an argument
game -> :state is where the state lives, everything else is game related such as systems, components, platform, etc
* DONE Change component state to not live in the component but under the :state key <2014-10-12 Sun>
CLOSED: [2014-10-12 Sun 17:20]
* TODO Tests [2/3] <2014-10-04 Sat>
- [X] CES internals
- [ ] Input system/components
- [X] Event system

* TODO Re-implement fixed timestep loop
http://codeincomplete.com/posts/2013/12/4/javascript_game_foundations_the_game_loop/
* TODO During movement change the players map position <2014-03-23 Sun>
Branch: map-position
Keep track of entities based on their map coordinates. Translate map coordinates into screen coordinates on render.
This should help with the collision issues so that movement is decoupled from the :player entity
- [ ] Add map-x and map-y to entities
- [ ] Add offset x and y to background layer
- [ ] On render apply offsets to the map and translate to screen changes
  - [ ] Tiles
  - [ ] Player
  - [ ] Monster

* TODO System for injecting adding/removing entities from the game state while game loop is running
* TODO Function to translate screen coords to map coords

* TODO Entity to Tile collision detection
- [ ] Boundary collisions (is a tile passable)
  - Check the players map position and find the nearest tile in the tile map
  - If the tile is passable then do nothing
  - If not then reset offset-x and offset-y to 0

* TODO Background rendering jumps using fixed timestep gameloop [/] <2014-04-05 Sat>
- Fix timestep loop causes rendering issues 
  - When you put the render system in iter-systems the movement is correct
  - When it's not you get inconsistencies in the rendering where certain parts are moved in weird ways like the background or monster
because render gets called outside of the systems step loop
- Tiles are moving but the Monster is 

** TODO Re-implement fixed timestep loop where render is outside of the timestep loop
Line 73 in engine.core

** TODO Add a new system for writing changes to screen coords after all systems complete
This way the render step is only for updating draw code and we don't have to be concerned with offsets
* TODO Multiple hit boxes per entity
- Entities should have body parts (multiple hit boxes)
- Body parts have a hitbox and are checked during collision detection
* TODO Test with simulation
Makes a series of state changes to the game and returns the end state once all steps are completed
Can be used for testing behavior visually and with real results
- [ ] Record game state
- [ ] Playback game state

* TODO Sprite animation rendering
- Fixed timestep animation?
  Each frame ticks the next frame in an animation
- Action list animation?
  This would allow the cancellation of an animation easily. Say a player is attacking and then get's hit halfway through the animation, could cancel the animation and start the hit animation
* TODO [#A] Sound system
System that reads an entities action list and global action list and plays the sound
* TODO Wrap pixi sprite calls into something more friendly
* TODO Make game-loop a function that takes in args for frame rate and main function to call
* TODO Draw ordering of entities to know which should be in front of what
* TODO When moving, keep the player in the center unless the border is < 1/2 the distance to the player then allow the player to move towards it
* TODO Action list
* TODO Inspect protocol
All game engine things must be inspectable, returning details about it's current state
* TODO Entity message passing
Pass a message from one entity to another and process the list of messages
Processing the list of messages can result in generating actions on the action list

* Macros
** TODO defsystem
Takes a scene state and handler fn and returns a function
** TODO defgame
Takes a collection of scenes where the default scene is the first one
Implements a fixed time step game loop
Loads the stage (rendering engine)
What happens if there is more than one defgame?

** TODO defscene
A collection of systems and initial state for managing the systems. Returns an atom with a hashmap representing the scene state. Returns a hashmap of functions for managing the scene such as state resets
** TODO defentity does not work due to issues with eval from another ns
 - Metadata on def does not work in clojurescript

* DONE Require state dependencies 
CLOSED: [2014-10-04 Sat 19:18]
This is probably too restrictive. Instead allow an arguments function that parses state and is applied to the component function.
- Specify your state dependencies in your component function
- Call your component function with the state in the order specified
- Return value must be a vector of all state to be merged in
- Example:
  (defcomponent stuff [input stage me]
    (my-fn input stage me))
  Calls a fn to get deps out of state
  Takes the return result and makes it merg-able with global state

- the first time and requires calling start-game! 
- there is a race condition where the renderer starts before the window has a width or height causing an error when pixijs renderer is called
- Need to load the asset for the tile background using an asset loader

  - Maybe the order of the systems is wrong?
    - Moved movement phase to right before the collision detection
    - Render phase now applies the offsets calculated and applies them to the sprite
  - !!! Player has an offset even though it's screen position will not change
    - Monster also has an offset based on the player's offset
    - [X] Use a global screen offset when user input comes in to control
    - [X] Other entities then use the screen offset for their own movement and screen position
    - Movement stop on collision works when both entities have collision detection on and the player is passed in to the collision check without any offsets
    - Tiling works correctly when offsetst are removed but the monster moves with the player equally

  - The input handler can be on constantly and the user input step takes the latest value of the atom during a run through the game loop
  - Player was able to perform an illegal move 
    From 
    (collision? 361 250 30 288 250 40)
    To
    (collision? 361 250 30 292 250 40)
    Even though they were colliding
- Player and monster are sharing the same offset-x and why which will negate each other during collision detection because the detector applies the offsets before checking. This makes it impossible to move away from a collision
- How movement works
  1. User input
  2. Player adds an offset based on user input
  3. Monster adds an offset based on the players offset
  4. Collision detection runs
  5. Offsets are removed if there is a collision
  6. Sprite positions updated based on applying offsets to screen position
